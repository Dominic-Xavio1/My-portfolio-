        <h2>My Journey as A Front End and Back End programmer</h2>
        <p>I'm a passionate software engineer with a strong foundation in <strong>[Programming languages:</strong>HTML, JAVASCRIPT, CSS, PYTHON, REACT, frameworks, 3d Designer]. My journey began in at young age, 
            where I developed a love for technology and problem-solving at that time.<br><br>
            After completing my Ordinary Level, I embarked on a career in software development. 
            Over the years, I've honed my skills in <string>software development</string> and worked on a variety of projects.<br><br>
            Beyond my technical expertise, I'm a dedicated to read books, play karate and designing. This passion has taught me the
            importance of discipline, perseverance, and continuous learning. I believe these qualities translate well into my professional life.<br><br>
            My goal is to contribute to innovative projects and create solutions that have a positive impact on the world. I'm always eager to learn 
            new things, collaborate with talented individuals, and push the boundaries of what's possible in the field of software engineering.
